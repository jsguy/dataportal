Transfer JSON efficiently across websockets to multiple clients

## Um, why?

Curiosity - I've seen many other implementations - including what they do in Meteor - they all seem unnessecarily complex for something as simple as syncing JSON across a websocket, so this is just an experiement to see if it can be done a little simpler.
